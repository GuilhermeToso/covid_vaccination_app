# COVID-19 Worldwide Vaccination Progress
-----------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to build a web application that tracks in real time the Covid-19 worldwide vaccination progress. The app shows a dashboard where the user can interact with different types of charts and see how many people received the 1-dose or the 2-dose in the world, or by continents, incomes and even by countries.

The data base used is from the [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv) github page.

I hope you all have some fun!
